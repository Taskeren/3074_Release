# 3074_Release

This is the place to release Thirty-Seventy-Four or 3074 application made by the Genius Warlock lol.

## What's Thirty-Seventy-Four(3074)?

Thirty-Seventy-Four is a wrapping application invoking NetLimiter, so that BattlEye cannot detect it. What's more, 3074 also provides a in-game overlay, and you can see wheter you are limiting or not.
It is inspired by [klimV2](https://github.com/KawaiiKraken/klimV2), was an alternative of NetLimiter.

## How to Use?

I don't want to talk about how to limit here, but the 3074 itself.

1. You need to install NetLimiter 5 properly. It works fine with 5.2.6.0.
2. Then you should download the [latest pack of 3074](https://github.com/Taskeren/3074_Release/releases/latest), and extract it into somewhere.
3. Start *tsf_3074.exe*, and a file selector should popup. Select your Destiny 2 application.
4. If nothing is wrong, 3074 should be fine and visible in top left corner of your screen.
5. Press <kbd>alt + c</kbd> to open keybinding configuration window, where you can click the button of the port.
6. Another window should popup, and you just press the keys then press enter.
7. After you setting all the keybindings, you can close the configuration window by click the X in the top right corner.
8. Enjoy the 3074.
